# What is it

Here's my experiments with Three.js in Expo. But I used other model (t-shirt) here, because porsche returns errors that's hard to inspect (more about it here: https://github.com/pmndrs/react-three-fiber/issues/1972)

Have made like before: added possibility to change a color of the model

## What plans for the future

2. Add more design elements
3. Add posibility to change a color for coats
4. Add posibility to add logos on t-shirt.
